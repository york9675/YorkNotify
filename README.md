## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- **A Computer** with macOS.
- **Xcode** installed (requires macOS 13 or higher to support development for iOS 16 and above). You can download Xcode from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835).
- **iPhone/iPad** (physical device or simulator) requires iOS 16 or higher. If it is a physical machine, please enable "Developer Mode" first.
- **Apple Developer Account** (free or paid) for code signing and device testing.

## Steps to Import and Run the Project in Xcode

### 1. Clone the Repository

- You can download the project as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository and extract it to your desired location.

- Alternatively, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/york9675/YorkNotify.git
```

### 2. Open the Project in Xcode

1. **Open Xcode**.
2. **Open the Project**: Navigate to the directory where you cloned/downloaded the project, then open the `YorkNotify/src/YorkNotify.xcodeproj`.

### 3. Set Up Signing & Capabilities

1. **Select Your Team**:  
   - In Xcode, click on the project in the project navigator.
   - Go to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab.
   - Under the **Team** dropdown, select your Apple ID (if it‚Äôs not there, add your Apple ID under Xcode > Preferences > Accounts).
   - Ensure that **Automatically manage signing** is checked.

2. **Provisioning Profile**:  
   Xcode will automatically generate a provisioning profile for you, allowing you to run the app on your physical device.

### 4. Choose Your Target Device

1. In the top toolbar, select your target device (e.g., iPhone simulator or your connected iPhone) from the dropdown menu.
2. Ensure your device is connected via USB or select a simulator if you don‚Äôt have a physical device available.

### 5. Build and Run the App

1. **Build the Project**:  
   Click the **Run** button (the play icon) in the top-left corner of Xcode. Xcode will compile the code and build the app.
   
2. **Run the App**:  
   After the build is successful, Xcode will automatically install the app on the selected device or simulator.

3. **Trusting the Developer on iPhone (if required)**:  
   If you‚Äôre using a free developer account and testing on a physical iPhone, you may need to manually trust the app. Go to:
   - **Settings** > **General** > **VPN & Device Management** > **Your Apple ID** > **Trust**.

> [!WARNING]\
> If you're using a free Apple Developer account, the app's code signing is only valid for 7 days. After that period, the app will no longer launch, and you'll need to reinstall it by re-running the project in Xcode.

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Errors**: If you encounter build errors, check the build output in Xcode for clues on missing files, configurations, or dependencies.

## Bug report / Feedback

If you encounter any problems during use or have feedback, please fill out **[this form](https://forms.gle/o1hFjy4q98Ua1H7L7)** to report.

## Support

When I began developing apps, my mission was simple: to create genuinely helpful tools and offer them for free. In a world saturated with paid features and ads, I aimed to build something that anyone could use without cost, simply to make life a little easier. My apps have always been ad-free, and some, like this project, are open-source. If my work can help even a small group of people become more efficient or solve a problem, it‚Äôs worth it.

However, as a student and independent developer, I‚Äôve encountered some financial challenges. The $99 annual fee for Apple‚Äôs Developer Program has become a significant hurdle. This membership is necessary to unlock key iOS features, like Time-Sensitive Notifications, and to distribute apps on the App Store. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs a cost I can‚Äôt currently afford. I‚Äôve even had to use a Hackintosh because I don‚Äôt have the resources to purchase a Mac for development.

Despite these challenges, I remain committed to keeping this app **completely free**‚Äîwith no ads or in-app purchases. But in order to make the app fully functional and accessible to iOS users, I need assistance covering the Apple Developer Account fee.

### How You Can Help

- **Collaborate:** If you‚Äôre a developer, designer, or have ideas for improvement, feel free to contribute to the project by creating issues, submitting pull requests, or improving documentation!

Your support, in any form, will help unlock the full potential of this app and keep it free for everyone. Thank you for helping keep this vision alive!
